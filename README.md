<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

This repo was written as part of the Turing School of Software Design's group project requirements for Mod 2. We were tasked with building new features to a mock e-commerce website in accordance to a series of 40 user stories. The stories built functionality where merchants and admins can manage inventory and fulfill customer invoices. The project was designed to demonstrate a number of learning objectives, including:

* Practice designing a normalized database schema and defining model relationships.
* Utilize advanced routing techniques including namespacing to organize and group like functionality together.
* Utilize advanced active record techniques to perform complex database queries.
* Practice consuming a public API while utilizing POROs as a way to apply OOP principles to organize code.
